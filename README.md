# A Small Twitter Clone

Demo: https://twitter-lite.mikesukmanowsky.com/

Wanted to play around with React and Firebase and get over some of the hurdles
I had in learning this stuff.

Could add a lot more functionality, but just wanted to get the basics:

- Create accounts and profiles
- Be able to tweet
- Like a tweet that isn't yours
